      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Bryan McCaffrey. I'm currently a Junior High English 
        teacher. I started programming a year ago and fell in love with it. 
        Since then I've taken a couple of courses on Udemy, worked through 
        Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree, completed several online tutorials, 
        and read a good number of O'Reilly books. I am currently seeking a 
        full-time position in front-end development at the end of this academic
         year (May 24th).

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <h3>Aspirations</h3>
      <p>
        Web development is uniquely positioned to allow us to help and serve 
        so many different people in so many different walks of life. My goal 
        in pursuing web development is to help people share their content, 
        ideas, products, services, and very selves with others.
